# LeviTAS PCB

This is a PCB test platform originally build for the LeviTAS project.

A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller controls four 0-240V high voltage outputs and can simultaneously read from four FDC2112 capacitance sensors. The architecture and code should be straightforward to re-engineered to add more channels.
